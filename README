----------------------------------------------------

This is a simple helper script that allows you to use
the Address2Cooridnates API from the Data Science Toolkit
in Google Refine.

The script standardizes the returned function to a value
that can be parsed by Google Refine's engine.


To use:

1) Upload the script to your webserver
2) In Google Refine select the column with your address
3) Select Create new column from URL
4) Enter 'yourserver.com/index.php?address=' + escape(value,'url') in the query box
5) Select the new column just created and create new field based on that column
6) In the formula box enter: value.parseJson().result.fieldname
